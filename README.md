## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete ROS2-based simulation and navigation setup for the MR-Buggy3 robot, developed for the NXP AIM India Challenge 2025. It includes navigation behavior trees, SLAM configuration, and a warehouse environment built in Ignition Gazebo. The buggy is capable of autonomously navigating through different warehouse worlds while detecting shelf data in real-time.

## Videos Submitted

The following videos are part of the submission, as per the guidelines:

- warehouse_1.mp4
- warehouse_2.mp4
- warehouse_3.mp4
- warehouse_4.mp4

Each video includes:
- Right half of screen: Gazebo simulation showing MR-Buggy3 in action
- Left half of screen: Terminal window running `ros2 topic echo /shelf_data`

## Code Description

nav_to_pose_bt.xml  
â†’ Custom Behavior Tree used for single-goal navigation with nodes for path following, goal checking, and recovery behaviors like spinning and waiting.

nav_through_poses_bt.xml  
â†’ Multi-waypoint navigation BT file to traverse various zones in a warehouse sequentially.

nav2.yaml  
â†’ Parameter file for ROS2 Navigation Stack: includes planner configs, DWB controller parameters, global/local costmap tuning, inflation radius, recovery behaviors, etc.

slam.yaml  
â†’ SLAM Toolbox configuration for online mapping, real-time loop closure, and map merging.

## How to Launch Simulation

source install/setup.bash  
ros2 launch nxp_aim_india_2025 bringup_sim.launch.py world:=warehouse_1.sdf slam:=true

Repeat with warehouse_2.sdf, warehouse_3.sdf, etc., to test on other maps.

---

## Shelf Data Output

To monitor detected shelves:  
ros2 topic echo /shelf_data

The data includes shelf ID, relative position, and pose, aiding in inventory scanning and path planning.
